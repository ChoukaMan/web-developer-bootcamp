Goes straight to explaining what to code

good at following a path with continuous small improvment

doesn't explain the subjects in depth only just enough to be able to code.
Advantage : quick learning
Disavantage : superficial, doesn't talk about security risk (forma data from user,..), application can crash (findbyid returns null)


very few exercices (do this on your own then let's check the result)

He explains before doing
I suggest people try to code before checking what is done in the video

Some changes since video taken
api change
api/service used closing : cloud9, imdb api


cloud9 is nic but had a bug where text editor is on one or two lines
